This is my version of Conway's Game of Life.
Go to conwaygame.tk

It has two key innovations:
(1) You can click on the buttons on the left to change the rules of life and death
(2) Cell's hue is a function of their age

This makes it fun and beautiful! Let me know how I can improve it. Feel free to submit issues to this Github repo.

Enjoy.
